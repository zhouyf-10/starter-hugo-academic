abstract: "Quantum-empowered electromagnetic transients program (QEMTP) is a promising paradigm for tackling EMTP's computational burdens. Nevertheless, no existing studies truly achieve a practical and scalable QEMTP operable on today's noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. The strong reliance on noise-free and fault-tolerant quantum devices--which appears to be decades away--hinder practical applications of current QEMTP methods. This paper devises a NISQ-QEMTP methodology which for the first time transitions the QEMTP operations from ideal, noise-free quantum simulators to real, noisy quantum computers. The main contributions lie in: (1) a shallow-depth QEMTP quantum circuit for mitigating noises on NISQ quantum devices; (2) practical QEMTP linear solvers incorporating executable quantum state preparation and measurements for nodal voltage computations; (3) a noise-resilient QEMTP algorithm leveraging quantum resources logarithmically scaled with power system dimension; (4) a quantum shifted frequency analysis (QSFA) for accelerating QEMTP by exploiting dynamic phasor simulations with larger time steps; (5) a systematical analysis on QEMTPs performance under various noisy quantum environments. Extensive experiments systematically verify the accuracy, efficacy, universality and noise-resilience of QEMTP on both noise-free simulators and IBM real quantum computers."
