abstract: "Transient stability assessment (TSA) is a cornerstone for resilient operations of todays interconnected power grids. This paper is a confluence of quantum computing, data science and machine learning to potentially address the power system TSA issue. We devise a quantum TSA (QTSA) method to enable scalable and efficient data-driven transient stability prediction for bulk power systems, which is the first attempt to tackle the TSA issue with quantum computing. Our contributions are three-fold: 1) A high expressibility, low-depth (HELD) quantum circuit is designed for accurate and noise-resilient TSA; 2) A quantum natural gradient descent algorithm is developed for efficient HELD circuit training; 3) A systematical analysis on QTSAs performance under various quantum factors is per-formed. QTSA underpins a foundation of quantum-enabled and data-driven power grid stability analytics. It renders the intractable TSA straightforward and effortless in the Hilbert space, and therefore provides stability information for power system operations. Extensive experiments on quantum simulators and real quantum computers verify the accuracy, noise-resilience, scalability and universality of QTSA."
