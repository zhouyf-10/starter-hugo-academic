I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University. I received my Bachelor's degree in 2014 and my Ph.D. degree in 2019, both from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University. My research focuses on collaboratively integrating machine learning, quantum computing, and formal methods to enable intelligent, adaptive, and provably resilient power system operations and supporting extreme renewable energy integration.
